Regioncodes
======

Unfinished. Currently, partly usable.

What this gem currenly does:

It inserts a table/model into your application called "regioncodes".

It also provides tasks for inserting/migrating the table and importing 
the region data from the data folder.

Regioncodes depends on fastercsv plugin.


Example
=======


How to install this plugin within your Ruby on Rails application:

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/nkokkos/regioncodes.git



How to create/migrate the regioncodes table

At the root of your application do :

rake db:migrate:regioncodes



How to insert the data (about 20,000+ records) into the table 
(it will take a long time!): 

rake regioncodes:insertdata


If you want to test the insertdata task, go to the tasks folder and modify the
task command, in order to import a different smaller file from the 
data folder (e.g test_data_csv)
