Regioncodes
======

Unfinished. Currently, partly unusable.

What this gem currenly does:

It inserts a table/model into your application called "regioncodes".

It also provides tasks for inserting the table and importing the data from the data folder.


Example
=======


How to install this plugin within your application:

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/nkokkos/regioncodes.git


How to create/migrate the regioncodes table

At the root of your application do :

rake db:migrate:regioncodes


How to insert the data into the table (it will take a long time). 

rake regioncodes:insertdata

If want to test the insertdata task, go to the tasks folder to choose a 
different smaller file to import from the data folder (test_data.csv)
